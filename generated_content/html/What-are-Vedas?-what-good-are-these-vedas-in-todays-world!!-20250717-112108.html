These texts, composed over thousands of years, form the philosophical bedrock of Indian culture and continue to influence its spiritual and intellectual traditions to this day.</p>

<h3>Overview of Vedic Scriptures and Their Classification</h3>

<p>Vedic literature is primarily divided into two categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Shruti</strong>: These texts are considered to be 'heard' or 'revealed'. They include the four Vedas - Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. Each Veda is further divided into four parts - the Samhitas (hymns), the Brahmanas (ritualistic texts), the Aranyakas (transition texts), and the Upanishads (philosophical texts).</li>
<li><strong>Smriti</strong>: These texts are considered to be 'remembered' and include the Dharma Shastras, the Puranas, and the Itihasas (epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata).</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Key Themes in Vedic Philosophy</h3>
