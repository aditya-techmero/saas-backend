The four Vedas - Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda - form the bedrock of Vedic literature. Each Veda has four subdivisions - the Samhitas (hymns), the Brahmanas (ritualistic texts), the Aranyakas (forest texts), and the Upanishads (philosophical texts). 

### The Relevance of Vedic Philosophy Today

While it's easy to dismiss these texts as antiquated relics of a bygone era, the Vedic philosophy holds profound relevance in today's world. Here's why:
- **Spiritual Enlightenment**: The Vedas offer profound insights into life's existential questions, facilitating spiritual enlightenment.
- **Holistic Living**: They advocate a balanced approach towards life, emphasizing the importance of physical health, mental well-being, and spiritual growth.
- **Social Harmony**: The Vedas preach the philosophy of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,' which means 'the world is one family,' promoting global peace and harmony.
- **Environmental Consciousness**: They underscore the importance of respecting nature and living sustainably, a lesson more relevant than ever in the face of climate change.
