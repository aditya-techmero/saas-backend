The Vedas, the ancient scriptures of India, are a vast body of knowledge that encompasses a wide range of subjects, from philosophy and mythology to rituals and ethics. These texts, composed over thousands of years, form the philosophical bedrock of Indian culture and continue to influence its spiritual and intellectual traditions to this day.

### Overview of Vedic Scriptures and Their Classification

Vedic literature is primarily divided into two categories:
- **Shruti**: These texts are considered to be 'heard' or 'revealed'. They include the four Vedas - Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. Each Veda is further divided into four parts - the Samhitas (hymns), the Brahmanas (ritualistic texts), the Aranyakas (transition texts), and the Upanishads (philosophical texts).
- **Smriti**: These texts are considered to be 'remembered' and include the Dharma Shastras, the Puranas, and the Itihasas (epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata).
