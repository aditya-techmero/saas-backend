The term 'Veda' comes from the Sanskrit word 'Vid', which means 'to know'. Hence, the Vedas are the 'books of knowledge'. They are the oldest and most authoritative scriptures of Hinduism, composed around 1500 to 600 BCE. 

There are four main Vedas:

1. **Rigveda** - The oldest of all, it consists of hymns praising the deities.
2. **Samaveda** - It contains verses to be sung during rituals and ceremonies.
3. **Yajurveda** - It contains prose mantras and verses for rituals.
4. **Atharvaveda** - It includes spells and charms, reflecting a more folk and tribal tradition.

Each Veda is further divided into two sections: the 'Samhitas' or hymns, and the 'Brahmanas' or explanations of rituals.

### Exploring Vedic Philosophy

The wisdom of the Vedas extends beyond religious rituals. It encompasses philosophies about the nature of reality, the self, and the universe. Vedic philosophy presents concepts like 'Dharma' (moral duties), 'Karma' (law of action and reaction), and 'Moksha' (liberation from the cycle of birth and death). For example, the concept of Karma is now universally recognized and often referred to as 'what goes around comes around'.
